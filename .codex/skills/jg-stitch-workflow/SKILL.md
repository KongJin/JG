description: >-
  Project-specific Stitch workflow for the JG repo. Use whenever Codex works with `.stitch/DESIGN.md`, `.stitch/prompt-briefs`, `.stitch/contracts`, Stitch screen generation/editing, or preparing Stitch outputs for Unity UI Toolkit candidate surfaces in this repository. In JG, this skill is a thin router: it points to the active owner docs for prompt-brief refinement and structured handoff preparation, then hands off Unity implementation to `jg-stitch-unity-import` or `jg-unity-workflow`. Route cohesion/coupling judgment to `jg-coupling-review`, and route document lifecycle or 문서 응집도 work to `jg-doc-lifecycle`.

Use this skill only as a router for the JG Stitch lane.
Do not restate workflow policy or artifact rules here.
Resolve current paths through `docs/index.md`, then follow the owner docs.
If the current collaboration mode is `Plan Mode`, use this skill for inspection/reference only. Do not mutate `.stitch` artifacts or handoff outputs from this lane.

## Read First

1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read `docs/index.md` to resolve the current owner paths.
3. Read owner doc `ops.cohesion-coupling-policy` when the task needs owner boundaries, cohesion/coupling judgment, or responsibility splitting.
4. Read owner doc `ops.stitch-data-workflow`.
5. Read owner doc `ops.stitch-structured-handoff-contract` when the task writes, reviews, or translates a contract.
6. Read owner doc `design.ui-reference-workflow` when the task needs Stitch visual principles or reference usage rules.
7. If the task creates or substantially rewrites a plan doc, read owner doc `ops.plan-authoring-review-workflow` before editing the plan.
8. If the task needs acceptance, blocked/mismatch wording, or closeout judgment, read owner doc `ops.acceptance-reporting-guardrails`.
9. Read `plans.progress` when the task touches set-level planning or `.stitch` inventory priority.
10. Read the accepted source freeze first. Only after that, inspect the execution contracts that were derived from it.

## Routed Artifacts

- `.stitch/DESIGN.md`
- `.stitch/prompt-briefs/*.md`
- `.stitch/contracts/blueprints/*.json`
- `.stitch/contracts/schema/*.json`
- `.stitch/contracts/screens/*.json`, `.stitch/contracts/mappings/*.json`, `.stitch/contracts/presentations/*.json` when present as review/reference artifacts only

한 줄 기준:

- 읽기 순서는 항상 `source freeze -> execution contracts -> UI Toolkit candidate/output`이다.
- stored contract files는 source freeze를 건너뛰게 만드는 시작점이 되면 안 된다.

## Task Routing

- `brief update`: refine an existing prompt brief
- `screen generation/edit`: update Stitch output as needed, then freeze the accepted source first
- `contract translation`: derive execution contracts from the accepted source. When source에서 바로 준비되는 구조라면 stored `screens/mappings` 파일은 review/reference artifact로만 다룬다.
- `unity handoff`: stop after the contract is precise enough, then switch to `jg-unity-workflow`
- `plan authoring`: after drafting or substantial plan edits, run the repeat re-review loop from `ops.plan-authoring-review-workflow` before closeout
- `acceptance closeout`: use `ops.acceptance-reporting-guardrails` for mechanical vs acceptance separation and blocked/mismatch judgment
- In `Plan Mode`, stop at routing, inspection, and contract review. Do not rewrite `.stitch/contracts/*.json`, prompt briefs, or handoff artifacts.

## Practical Loop

Use this loop when the user wants to translate one accepted screen carefully:

1. Lock the accepted baseline screen first. Do not mix a candidate variant into the same pass.
2. Keep the accepted Stitch `png/html` visible while working. Do not start from old contract files.
3. Write or review the `screen intake` from source-derived facts only.
4. Derive or update the execution contracts only after the source freeze is stable.
5. Before handing off to Unity, compare `accepted source -> execution contracts` and remove any guessed CTA, state, or block meaning that is not grounded in the source.

## Fidelity Hints

When reviewing or updating Stitch-side artifacts, preserve at least these source decisions:

- first read and second read order
- block direction such as `strip`, `row`, `stack`, `single scroll body`
- emphasis posture: what is primary, secondary, and auxiliary
- whether preview / summary / empty state feels finished or placeholder-like
- primary CTA posture: width, persistence, and visual weight

If the screen clearly communicates one of these and the intake/manifest does not, fix the Stitch-side artifact before handing off to Unity.

## Closeout

1. The relevant prompt brief matches the current intent.
2. The active execution contract and its relevant references are updated when needed.
3. The contract satisfies the completeness criteria in `ops.stitch-structured-handoff-contract`.
4. If Unity implementation happened, the Unity evidence path is newer than the contract it implements.
5. If the surface has a review route, the latest SceneView capture is newer than the contract it implements.
